If you are using Python you can find the common letters in two strings using the `set` datastructure. For example:

```python
>>> set('abc') & set('bcd')
{'b', 'c'}
```

In the first part we split the given string into two halves and find the common letters in the two halves. In the second part we find the common letters in the three strings.
